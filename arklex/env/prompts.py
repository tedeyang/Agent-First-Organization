"""Prompt templates and management for the Arklex framework.

This module provides prompt templates for various components of the system, including
generators, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), workers, and database operations. It
supports multiple languages (currently English and Chinese) and includes templates for
different use cases such as vanilla generation, context-aware generation, message flow
generation, and database interactions.

Key Components:
- Generator Prompts:
  - Vanilla generation for basic responses
  - Context-aware generation with RAG
  - Message flow generation with additional context
  - Speech-specific variants for voice interactions
- RAG Prompts:
  - Contextualized question formulation
  - Retrieval necessity determination
- Worker Prompts:
  - Worker selection based on task and context
- Database Prompts:
  - Action selection based on user intent
  - Slot value validation and reformulation

Key Features:
- Multi-language support (EN/CN)
- Speech-specific prompt variants
- Context-aware generation
- Message flow integration
- Database interaction templates
- Consistent formatting across languages

Usage:
    # Initialize bot configuration
    config = BotConfig(language="EN")

    # Load prompts for the specified language
    prompts = load_prompts(config)

    # Use prompts in generation
    response = generator.generate(
        prompt=prompts["generator_prompt"],
        context=context,
        chat_history=history
    )
