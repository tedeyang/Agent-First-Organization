## Usage Examples

### Calling Reusable Workflows

```yaml
# In another workflow file
jobs:
  notify-success:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-send-notifications.yml
    with:
      notification-type: 'success'
      title: 'âœ… Build Successful'
      message: 'The build has completed successfully.'
      workflow-name: 'CI Pipeline'
      workflow-run-id: ${{ github.run_id }}
      workflow-run-url: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}
    secrets: inherit

  run-coverage:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-run-coverage-tests.yml
    with:
      min-coverage-threshold: '99.0'
```

## Setup Instructions

### Required Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack incoming webhook URL (for Slack notifications)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: SendGrid API key (for email notifications via SendGrid)
- `EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL`: Webhook URL for email service (for email notifications via webhook)

### Email Service Options

1. **SendGrid**: Set `email-service: 'sendgrid'` and provide `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
2. **Webhook**: Set `email-service: 'webhook'` and provide `EMAIL_WEBHOOK_URL`
3. **Debug**: Set `email-service: 'debug'` to print emails to logs (default)

## Differences from Composite Actions

- **Workflows** are complete workflows that can contain multiple jobs
- **Actions** are composite steps that run within a single job
- Workflows can be triggered by events or called by other workflows
- Actions are always called as steps within workflows
- Workflows have more complex structure with jobs, steps, and environment setup
- Actions are more focused and lightweight

## Notes

- Reusable workflows are designed to be called by other workflows using `uses:`
- Event-triggered workflows run automatically based on GitHub events
- All workflows include proper error handling and logging
- Debug mode is enabled by default for email notifications to prevent accidental emails
